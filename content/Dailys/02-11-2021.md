In optics, aberration is a property of optical systems, such as lenses, that causes light to be spread out over some region of space rather than focused to a point.[1] Aberrations cause the image formed by a lens to be blurred or distorted, with the nature of the distortion depending on the type of aberration

In an imaging system, it occurs when light from one point of an object does not converge into (or does not diverge from) a single point after transmission through the system

Two categories of aberrations commonly are used to describe refractive errors of the eye:

Lower-order aberrations consist primarily of nearsightedness and farsightedness (defocus), as well as astigmatism. .

In normal population the dominant aberrations are the ordinary second-order spherocylindrical focus errors, which are called refractive errors.They make up about 85 percent of all aberrations in an eye. Higher order aberrations are a relatively small component, comprising about 10% of the eye's total aberrations.[3] High order aberrations increase with age 

higher-order aberration is a distortion acquired by a wavefront of light when it passes through an eye with irregularities of its refractive components (tear film, cornea, aqueous humor, crystalline lens and vitreous humor).
- abnormal curvature, scar
- cataracts
- dry eyes

Examples

1. Trefoil aberration, is a triangular astigmatism with three axes. This higher order aberration causes the patient to suffer from glare and halos around objects. For example, one point could be seen as the Mercedes star due to the halos.
2. The Coma Aberration is a higher order aberration which is called this because a point is seen with a tail. That is, it is similar in shape to an orthographic coma or a comet. This visual problem occurs in patients with keratoconus, in refractive treatments of off-centre ablations or inclined or out-of-position intraocular lenses. One perceives it as double vision, halos and glare around objects, affecting both the contour and the corners of the images.
3. Spherical aberration is a problem linked to the natural shape of the eye, and everyone suffers from it to a greater or lesser degree. This defect prevents peripheral light rays from focusing on the retina, resulting in blurred and halosed vision. In low light we perceive the shape and details of objects less well. It therefore affects driving at night, in cinemas and in rain or snow

Many techniques for measuring the eye's aberrations have been described, The most common technique is Shack-Hartmann aberrometry.
1. RMS 
2. Zernike polynomials


Management
1. Low order aberrations (hyperopia, Myopia and regular astigmatism), are correctable by eyeglasses, soft contact lenses and refractive surgery
2. Customized Wavefront-guided refractive corneal laser treatments ลดที่มีอยู่เดิม ลดการเกิดหลัง laser/surgery
3. Lens, glasses แบบใหม่ๆ design มาเฉพาะมากขึ้น
